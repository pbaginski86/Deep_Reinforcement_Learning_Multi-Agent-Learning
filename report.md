# DRLND Project 3 Report (Collaboration and Competition)

## Introduction

After using project 2 in combination with a Soft-Actor-Critic method that wasn't performing well, then converting back to a DDPG algorithm, I decided to now stay in the DDPG family. I have this time used a solution known as MADDPG. The basic implementation is very similar
to the implementation in the paper referenced below. Additionally, this implementation resembles that of many other MADDPG solutions that are mostly identical in how the tensors flow through to their actions.
